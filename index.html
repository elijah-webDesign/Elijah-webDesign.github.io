            <p>The grass is <b>green.</b><br><br>
                The sky is <b>blue.</b><br><br>
                Heavenly God, why must you <em><b>burn</b></em> us with the light of you?<br><br> 
                This semester has been <b>long</b>, even though it's been a week.<br><br> 
                Surely college cannot be handled by the <i><b>weak.</b></i><br><br>
                We all will prevail, but we still act like <b>snails.</b><br><br>
                No worry! <br><br>
                Just give us a second!<br><br>
                For we are <i><b>Academic Weapons.</b></i><br>
                </p>
